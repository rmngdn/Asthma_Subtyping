# Asthma_Subtyping
My work on asthma subtyping with data (not in the repository...) from U-BIOPRED project.

Have a look at rawToMatrix.R that extract data from the raw dataset to make a matrix list (one matrix per type)
I've tested SNF on the data with default parameters: see SNF_on_asthma.R !

Cheers
